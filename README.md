# Twitter-Data-

Working with the Twitter page 'WeRateDogs' to access data and learning about Wrangle and Analysis

This is the forth project of Udacity Course. Since most of the data was given to us in the previous projects, this one focuses on the idea to use a certain API to gain/collect data and further work with it in the project. 

# Challange in the Way

Unfortunately, it was impossible for me to obtain the 'developer account' for Twitter. I have sent my application (with multiple email responds about WHY I need this account), but after a week of waiting for the verification I have decided to complete the project without obtaining the data online. Hence, I have downloaded a sample **'twitter_api' and 'twitter_json'**
